        BICYCLES FOB WOMEN.
        A novelty promised tor this rail Is a bicycle for
        lady riders. There are several ralr riders In this
        city ready to take to this lady bicycle when It
        comes. It will be so arranged that a ladv who
        will learn to ride It can do so with as much
        grace and propriety as she could ride a tricycle.
        It will be a modification or tue Hover type or
        bicycle for gentlemen with the backbone or irame
        curved downward like the letter U between the
        wheels, so that when the lady sits upon the sad
        dle there will be no obstruction in the way or her
        dress between her feet and the saddie. i he only
        trouble," said the dealer, "win be in mounting.
        Ladle.-&gt who ride will have to have gentlemen wltn
        them to assist them In mounting." Wuen the
        veioclpede came out early In the century, ma
        chines with the C shaped bacKbone were con

        SOME OF THE LOCAL WOMEN CYCLERS
        While tho superiority and irresistible
        fascination of cycling is a point yielded
        by all, there is still considerable agita
        tion and discussion in the matter of pro
        priety in costume. That, of course, is and
        will probably remain a matter of taste.
        Most, of tho dealers contend that a dia
        mond frame wheel is us advantageous for
        women as for men, and if that be proven
        by test and experience, some modifica
        tion or extenuation of tho obnoxious and
        derision-ha.inted bloomers will probably
        bo discovered or invented, as evory other
        demand iv nature and art has heretofore
        been supplied sooner or later.
        At present a natty skirt, rather shorter
        than walking length, with corduroy or
        leather leggings to the knee, and a trim
        snort I jacket or bodice, seems to answer
        every purnose for the present make of
        lady s wheel. Such a costume is practica
        ble, in no way conspicuous, and appears
        to bo the generally accepted model for a
        cycling costume. Perhaps artor a little
        the women who don't wear bloomers now
        because they "don't wish to be conspic
        uous," will not be found without the 01—
        for tho same reason. Quien sahc? Stranger
        things have happened.

        The one disadvantage of wearing
        bloomers is that when you fall off a bi
        cycle nobody knows whether you have
        frilled underwear on or nut. This is
        discouraging to some girls.
        Tncre is no oi-chloride of gold cure for
        the bloomer habit. When a woman once
        gets a taste tor hloomeis you might as
        well satisfy her craving tirst as last.
        ISiooineis are all rigtit and let them
        come, whether of the fullblown variety
        or of the kind that arc nipped in the bud
        —just abovo tho knee.

        The modern woman is knock kneed-
        She will probably loudly deny'the charge.
        Nay, more, she may be utterly ignorant
        of her defect. She may believe that her
        legs arc like unto Diana's when tho god
        dess leads her nymphs. But the truth
        remains, the average modern woman is
        knock-kneed. I lor physicians will tell
        her so. if other authorities aro not surti
        cient to convince her, sava the New York
        World.
        Had she been. wise, the fact might
        never have been known. Attired in volu
        minous draperiees. with skirts distended
        many yards abv&gtut her, no one could
        dream that hei legs wero other than the
        straightest, shapeliest ones possiolc. But
        she donned knickerbockers. She took to
        divided skirts and clothed herself in
        In New York
        Turkish trousers. Sne mounted a bicycle
        and th? truth was known. The average
        woman's logs show a tendency to con
        vert to a point at the knees, und hei bi
        cycle suit has shown it. The reason for
        this sao affliction is not pi tin. Perhur s
        it airaes from the fact that tb*s average
        Woman has heen. until recently, more oc
        cupied in anointing her face with com
        plexion lotions than in developing iter
        body. She has preferred riding in the
        elevated train to walking, and has chosen
        staying in the housi rather tlutn tramp
        ing, iter knees huvu in the meantime
        been preparing a quiet little revenge for
        their enforcod inactivity.
        Another explanation of tho knock-kneed
        tendency of women is advanced by some
        unregenerate and irreligious being who
        Los A nifties Poems
        says that women have knelt too ofton
        and too long. They have gone to chinch
        often and have knelt for long periods:
        they have knelt by cradles, adoring little,
        unintelligent, red-faced morsels of hu
        manity: and the man who advances this
        explanation of the knock-kneed woman
        maintains that it is her devotion to one
        or another object which has caused this
        grave defect.
        Whatever may be the cause, the fact
        remains. Look at the next group of
        trousered feminine bycichsts you happen
        to see. and observe if there i.s not that
        curve above the leather gaiters and below
        the Hannel trousers which reveals the im
        perfection.
        The cure is, of course, in exercising the
        knee until it assumes its proper propo?
        tfons and its proper relation to the leg.
        Walking, bicycle riding.swimming or any
        other exercise which develops the legs,
        will help to correct tho detect.. Until
        such time as it is corrected the woman
        who loves grace will wear garments dis
        playing less freely her imperfections.

        Bicycle leggings, gaiters, boots and
        shoes ol special design are shown in tbe
        shoe stores and department stores in
        great variety, says a writer in the Now
        York World. The fashionable makers
        of custom shoes tind an incidental boom
        in cheir business directly connected with
        the bicycle craze aud some of their fin ?st
        and costliest work is in the lino of laced
        or buttoned leggings and boots of extra
        length in tbe legs.
        A Sixth avenue dealer in boots and
        shoes has issued an illustrated.catalogue
        devoted entirely to ladies' and gentle
        men's bicyclo footwear. Designers ia
        shoe factories are racking their brains
        for new ideas in leggings and boots.
        The latter come in all shades of russet
        and tan. They are made with an extra
        long top. reaching to the center of tho
        call. They come in laces and differ only
        from the ladies' hunting boot, or boot
        for mountain wear, In that for bicycle
        use tlio sole must be single, thin and
        flexible.
        Comfortable as such a boot is. it is in no
        such favor among tho fair cyclers as
        leggings worn witli approved bicycle
        shoes. The latter conic in two styles,
        Oxford tios and plain frontla. c teaching
        just above the ankle. The soles are
        thin and the heel is low and flat. The
        Oxford ties are made up iv do'igola.
        patent leather, tans, russet calf and can
        vas. The regulation bicycle shoe, laced
        to support the ankle, is made in dongola,
        calf and canvas. Rubber or leather soles
        are optional, but rubber is no longer con
        sidered the pioper tiling. Tbe rat-trap
        pedals make tbe rubber soles unnecessary.
        Tbe legging is a necessity with either
        style of these shoes and it is in their
        construction that tlie designers of foot
        wear navo given to tbe tiado their best
        efforts.
        One window shows over sixty stylos of
        leggings. They are made up to button
        and to lace ami to lace with button effect,
        ami comprize ooze calf in the undressed
        or suede style and in all the rich tan
        tints, russet, wdiitc, red and brown Rus
        sia calf; enamelled calf in black, red and
        russet; dongola kid, kangaroo kid, cor
        duroy in gray, black, blue and purple;
        canvas in a variety of shades und heavy
        cloth specially woven for this purpose in
        every color likely to be worn in the con
        struction of bicycling costumes, itlues
        and grays predominate, and it is possi
        ble to match any of the prevailing shades
        of outing cloth in any of tbe big retail
        stores.
        Tan leggings are, however, supposed
        to go well with Buy costume. Leggings
        icady-inado range in value fioni X to $7.
        A w oman of the Mlcbaux club who in
        deference tuber high social position must
        have everything ruauo to order, pays
        from 113 CO $i"&gt for her leggings.
        Tho laced pattern worn by the ladies of
        the Lyceum company during the long rim
        of The Amazons is much affected, they
        are made Ol either ooze calf or russet leath
        er of russet color, velvety and rich in ap- 1
        pearanoe, and must fit like v glove fiom
        ankle to knoe. To do this and not ii ter
        ferc with tlie free motion of tbe limb is a
        triumph of tbe cordwainer's art. Tho
        greatest care must be taken in tbe cutting
        out ol leggings of this class. A slight
        mistako in measurement or cutting will
        ruin them in the eyes of tho fastidious
        costumer. That is why he charges $26,
        IMen are not overgiven to wearing leg
        gings as part of a bicyclo costume, pre
        ferring to show their manly limbs through
        the medium of plaid stockings. The
        bicycle legging for men is a simple affair
        closely resembling tbe riding legging in
        appearance. The bicycle legging, how
        ever, is not held to tbe blub by a strap
        under tbe foot, but rests lightly or. tho
        top of,the foot. They ire really intended
        as a protection in long journeys, and in
        the stores are shown only in corduroys,
        canvas and leather. Tlio low-quarter
        dongola kid or canvas shoe of Oxford tio
        pattern, with an especially stout flat heel
        and with a leather side, is the correct
        thing in men's bicyclo shoes.

        WHAT ONE MAY WEAR
        Comfort One Thing to Be
        Considered Then Comes
        Style
        SOME VERY UNIQUE COSTUMES
        Somber Blacks and Modest Blues Are
        Overshadowed by the Gay
        Costumes Seen
        Interest in conventional dress is rapidly
        disappearing and forms a less interesting
        topic of conversation among the fair sex
        than ever before. Now we bear on all
        sides, "what, kind of a bicycle costume
        have you; is your skirt narrow or wide,
        and your leggins a good tit about the
        ankles?"
        Die latest thing in the way ot skirts
        has just been Introduced. It Has a di
        vided skill ofrei'i, in the back, while from
        tho front it seems t) be an" ordinary
        tailor-made cycling suit. The woman
        who wears one of these will have to take
        lessons in dressing from her father, hus
        band or brother, and alas! for her who
        has nono of these! for the new skirt is
        got into just as a man gets into.hi., trous
        ers. Ttie underskirt made of the same
        material as the suit! is buttoned up In
        front, and tbe outer skirt is fastened over
        this by means of a row of buttons on
        each aide. The back has side plaits,
        meeting In tne middle at the waist, and
        the middle seam is fastened all the way
        dawn to the bottom of the skirt, which
        makes the adjustment in mounting ex
        ceedingly simple. The skirt, instead of
        hanging one-fifth on tho right, and fou
        fifths on the left side of the wheel, fa!ls
        e\cnlv divided, and is remarkably grace
        ful and modest, both when tbe wearer is
        walking and when she is riding. Around
        blazer coat, with flaring fronts, is worn
        with this skirt, aud leggins and caps come
        In the same material the matetial is an
        imported pepper-and-salt mixture, and is
        calculated to stand wear and tear, and
        dust.
        In saleo!!ng a costume there is one
        tiling that every woman, stout or lean,
        ricli or poor, should insist upon, and
        that is that the ikilt shall be opened on
        tlie sides and not in the back. Nothing
        looks worse on a wheel than a placKot
        gaping and awry.
        Something entirely new in tho way ol
        a cap has a soft crown, turned up with
        wings, and a stiff visor in front. This
        comes only in black, and is particularly
        adapted to older women.
        Por t'.iose whose faces are dainty and
        piquant the white duck Tarns are very
        becoming, and added to this, they laun
        dry easily.
        Tho tendency of women riders to wear
        dark suits entirely, may hi somewhat
        doubted when one learns that the latest
        in a cycling costume seen on a young
        rider,was guile a gaudy affair. The skirt
        was green tweed with white shirt and
        leather belt, cuffs and collars. Her red
        serge blazer coat shone out daringly with
        its twinkling gold buttons. To tv is she
        bad added red serge knickerbockers and
        a soft red felt hat. She had red ribbons
        tied to her wheel, and she looked as if
        lifo was good and May tbe best of all
        months of the year.
        I.wss showy, but quite as novel, may be.
        was a green cloth cycling suit,with white
        silk blouse, all frills and rlutliness. Over
        this came a green Figaro jacket, faced
        with white and a belt and necktie of tar
        tan red and green. No skirt at all was
        visible, but the knickerbockers wero so
        full you wouldn't have known the differ
        ence until you got to the Knees. At the
        knees they stopped and tartan stockings
        took their place helped out by soft cy
        cling shoes.
        The new stylo of the jersey for cycling
        is the prettiest thing imaginable. It lits
        tl o form closely, buttoning from each
        shoulder to the neck and having immense
        leg-o'-mutton sleeves which give ita truly
        feminine look. It is purchasable In plain
        colors or in Stripes. Durng the long warm
        rides tbe collar may be turned In, leaving
        tbe neck free and comfortable.
        The girl who seeks comfort even at the
        expense ol her figure will don the new
        corset waist. Any dressmaker may fash
        ion ibis garment from strong, elastic,
        washablo material. The only stiffening
        used is the wlmlebones along the center
        of tlie uack. The buttons fasten with
        loops of rubber.
        Many women wonder what to do with
        their skirts to keep them in place. If of
        cloth, a shot put into the insido of the
        hem will keep them nicely from Hying.
        If of washable material, live little open
        ings in the hem. wherein may be tacked
        live small, lead dress WjigbtS, should bo
        left when the skirt is being made.

        Bicycling is becoming so genoral that
        I any new device for adding to the comfort
        I f riders is of more than passing interest.
        Here are two. for example, that we illus
        trate for the benefit of the cyclists among
        our readers, says the Daily Report.
        First is a trouser guard, .rbich, in some
        form, is almost Indispensable when tbe
        rider is in ordinary street dress. The
        guard here shown has tho advantage of
        tiot binding the trousers around the
        ankle and thus creasing them out of
        shape; on tbe contrary, it keeps them in
        shape. It is made of steel wire, flattened
        at tbe'tnoutb of the guard, and slips on
        and off vory easily.
        Tho other illustration shows a skirt
        holder for women. By its use the skirt
        To Keep the Skirts Trim
        is prevented from flying up, thus secur
        ing safety and neatness at the same time.
        What a Woman Did
        Miss Julia Spillane of Denver demon
        strates uailv what a woman with pluck
        and a wheel can do. She is traveling
        through Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska
        and lowa in the interest of Cycling West,
        soliciting subsciiptions. She has been
        on tlie road for several montns. and has
        met with unparalleled succeßS. The
        wheelmen all along the line have ex
        tended to her every courtesy. .Miss Smb.
        lane is a rationalist. and*on« (if the lirst
        women ir, the west to appear in knicker
        bockers. She says: "Weather perniit-
        Por the Cycler
        ting, I rode my wheel in nearly every
        city and town visisted."
        Her latest long ride was from Kearney,
        Nebrasksa, to (fraud Island, a distance
        Of fdtty-tive miles, and from tnere to
        Fremont, where she met with snow and
        ice, tramping it from tneie to Omaha.
        Among the many noted women who
        ride bicycles in England, few, if any,
        possess a prettier wheel than Lady Dudley.
        Her machine is enamelled white and
        lined with blue and gold, lilted with real
        ivory handles. Lady Dudley is in the
        habit of taking long rides unaccom
        panied.

        Shortish skiri, stiffened from the ankle
        to the knee. —Philadelphia Press.

        "There's one tlr'ng about the bicycle
        crazo," said a tailor recently; "I believe
        it is going to revolutionize men's attire,
        which has been fo sombre for so many
        years. I-lress reformers have done mucb
        for women, but men's clothing is practi
        cally tho same year in and year out.
        "The leaders of fashion arc not as a
        rule robust, and the chaps who lead cotil
        lons have small legs. If tbo wheel devel
        ops tboir celves, as it will, I believe the
        age of short clothes will return, and knee
        breeches for evening dress may be seen
        again in drawing rooms, llloomers are
        popular, for a shapely woman likes folks
        to know it. Thin-legged men have a
        chance to build up their calves in sum
        mer for the winter's gayety."

        PRACTICAL COSTUMES THESE
        During the past few months many de
        signs for a suitable eostumo for women
        to wear when cycling havo appeared in
        the papers. Of these a few wore neat,
        practicable and woarable, but for the
        most part tbe designs were anything but
        practicable. In connection with this ar
        ticle appear six designs which are de
        signed by well-known tailors, and all
        have been tried and found to be as prac
        ticable as they are becoming. We are able
        to reproduce the sketches used in this
        connection through tbo courtesy of Ste
        phens it ffickok, the local agents of the
        Columbia bicycle.
        Costume No. 1 is designed and worn by
        Mrs. Jenness Miller. Mrs. Jenness Miller
        bas given to this suit ths name Colum
        bia, and describes It iv her lectures. The
        suit consists of trousers, designed to look
        as much like a divided skirt as possible,
        hanging trom a sleoveless underwaist,
        thus obviating the need of a belt at the
        waist. The trousers are gathered to n
        band at the knee. Tbe jackot is loose
        and comfortable, with long, full skirt.
        Leggings of elastic clotb reach to tbe
        knee. A cap of neat design completes
        tbe suit.
        Costume No. 2 is by Rcdfern of New
        York and London. It is an extremely
        smart costume, consisting of short skirt,
        worn over knickerbockers of the seine
        material, and waist with vest of red cloth
        and gold buttons under front of light box
        cloth. Leggings of box cloth. Alpine
        bat. The material recommended by Red
        fern Is a rich open tweed.
        No. 3 is a bicycle costume designed and
        Worn by Miss "Georgia Cayvan. This,
        costume consists|nf couave trousers and a
        amort Eton jacket with full sleeves, worn
        over a.shirt which may be either loose or
        close, or a dainty sweater or tight-fitting
        jersey bodico with or without sleeves.
        Around the waist is a bolt of suedo,
        drawn through a buckle. The trousers
        ere made without lining and in light
        serges for summer, a war n lining being
        added for winter wear. Leggings of jer
        rey cloth, when wanted, are worn from
        the shoe to abovo the knee, tho jersey
        cloth being elastic and affording full play
        to the ankles. A sailor hat, with chiffon
        at the side and Mercury wings, completes
        tbe costume.
        No. 4 is another design by Red fern.
        This is the eostumo for bicycling moat
        favored in Franot« It consists of the
        famous bloomers, with Norfolk coat,
        made of dark green tweeds, with collar
        and waistband of green cloth of very deep
        shade fastened by gold buckles. Tho long
        E alters are id slute-colored cloth to match
        at and gloves.
        No. 5 shows a design by OOSta Kraemer
        M New York city. The cost umo consists of
        ti medium plain skirt and a modification
        of the Eton jacket, with a soft roll collar
        and ends falling in front. With it is
        worn a dainty sweater or such waist as
        taste may dictate. The material may bo
        serge, cravenette or any id' the soft Wool
        ens. Legging of jorsey (loth or other
        elastic matorial. with trousers under the
        skirt, nic optional.
        No. fi ,s a second design by Gosta Krae
        mer of New York city. The trousers are
        of aooordton-plaited serge, very full und
        gathered to a band buttoning at the knee,
        or an accordion-plaited skirt may be worn
        Over knickerbockers producing almost tlie
        a same effect. The cout is single-breasted,
        intended to button us shown or to hang
        almost closed when unbuttoned. A sbirt
        waist of wool or silk is worn under the
        coat. Leggings of jersey cloth, when dc
        sirod, complete the costume.

        If a woman.will follow the pursuits of
        a man, will become an equal iv work and
        ambitions, she must have a practical cos
        tume. She cannot wait to grasp her
        skirts if ;sho must grasp a particular car
        railing; she cannot wait for her skirts if
        she must bo at the otiice in timo to begin
        work with her brother. The woman of
        leisure need tukc no part in the demand
        for reform dress, only inasmuch as sho
        choosea to assist her working sister.
        So says Mrs. Russell Sage, whoso opin
        ion is not only valuable because she is
        Mrs. Sage, but equally so as coming from
        a woman who is a careful reasoner.a sym
        pathising sister and one capable of ex
        pressing her views in a manner attractive
        and logical.
        Tho bloomer question was to be the
        subject of my interview, and as I sat on
        tho sofa which Mrs. Sage told mo was ono
        hundred years old, I wondered what tig
        tires of weight and means might be regis
        tered on those springs, and I could not
        lefrain from crushing one blue cushion
        unmercifully,
        Cedarhusrt, L. 1., is the summer home
        of the Sages and tho scene of my inter
        view. Mrs. Sage told me of her home in
        Syracuse, where she knew the real Mrs.
        Bloomer. Mrß. Sage as a girl was Miss
        slocum, daughter of Joseph Slocuin.
        Tho atmosphere of her home at Syracuse
        was entirely conservative. Nevertheless
        when tbe people came to Syracuse to the
        anti-slavery meetings, wnen Dr. Samuel
        May gathered the progressive set about
        him there and Mrs. Bloomer came in
        from Seneca Palls, Mrs. Sage very often
        attendej tne meetings.
        Dr. May was a powerful factor in the
        anti-slavery cause, and Mrs. Bloomer was
        also an abolitionist. She came us a dele
        gate and her costume excited some atten
        tion. Her maimer, us Mrs. Sage remem
        bers her, was unpretentious, quiet and
        delicately feminine. Her costume showed
        a total disregard ior effect, and was man
        ish only to tbe extent of practicability.
        Her bodice was soft and baited at the
        waist, her collar ample and correct, us
        was also ber prim bonnet; ber skirt fell
        halt way from knee to ankle, and then
        the bloomer—really a pantalet—made ol
        tbe same black material as thereat of ber
        costume, reaching to her boot tops.
        In those days pantalets were the vogue,
        and Mrs. Sage smiled as she told me of
        her own favorite pair, with four little
        ruttles, always crimped for Sunday. Mrs.
        Bloomer did not appear too stong-minded
        then, us she only gave up muslin for tbe
        more serviceable matorial. As Mrs.
        Sage so knew Mrs. Bloomer, she agreed
        that she was entirely what sbo aimed to
        be—a practical woman, progressive and
        competent of realizing results from her
        theories.
        Mrs. Miller, n daughter of Gerrit Smith
        of Syracuse, was the next noticeable
        patron of the bloomers, but ber costumes
        were always of handsome black silk.
        "That clock is seventy-live years old.
        Tt was my mother's," said Mrs. Sago,
        pointing to a pretty hanging clock m tbe
        drawing room, "I wind it always myself
        and to do so must step upon tbat table.
        Iv this effort I-rind my skirts dangerous
        us well as inconveniet. Yet I consider
        woman can only afford to sacrilice the
        grace of skirts at the altar of necessity.
        A woman's dinner party would be as
        ordinary aa a club luncheon without the
        added charm of variety of costume. But
        ns v street or walking dress we need a
        uniform which can be worn till worn out
        on every outdoor occasion. This need
        not embrace coat, vest, necktie, etc., but
        should essentially contain all—but only
        all it calls for a comfortable, practical
        walking costume. whether bloomer,
        divided skirt or pantalet, with any femi
        nine variations of which it will reason
        ably admit. On a bicycle, of course, I
        cannot sco how a woman would attempt
        to rid» without the bloomer."—New
        York Herald.

        The new rider is content to go out on
        tho boulevard In long troutien tightened
        at the siiklcs with steel bands, but pro
        ficiency usually brings an abhorrence of
        this inappropriate costume. Many skilled
        bicyclists would rather stay at home than
        he seen riding on Riversiae drive in or
        dinary trousers. Thus the appearance
        of the world on wheels tends to become
        more and more agreeable. Hut many
        queer combinations in clothing are slill
        to be seen. Some of those who wear tbe
        long trousers choose an old pair. Occas
        ionally this garment is so far gonthe fringes at tlie bottom are almost
        rulHles. Perhaps a scarlet j.Tsoy shirt
        and scarlet cap are worn witli the trous
        ers. A part of the ridres consider any
        thing good enough for wheeling, and so
        rig tnemselves out in soiled clothes origi
        nally intended tor tennis, rowing or base
        ball. The flaring colors in their con
        trasts suggest an east side costume ball.
        College oarsmen and football players don't
        want spick and span new uniforms, and
        even take tho trouble to roll in the dirt
        with them to tone them down, but there
        seems no good reason why a man who
        dresses carefully for uuainass should ap
        pear like a scarecrow on his wheel. Tho
        "bicycle stoop" and worn out or inap
        propriate clotniug oftun go together.—
        Now York Tribune.

        In tho discussion of women's cycling
        costumes, too little attention has been
        given to footwear. Upon this fundamen
        tal point practical riders differ, and with
        good reason. They agree that heavy
        stockings, ribbod or smooth, of cotton or
        woolen, are essential, silk hose being ab
        solutely barred by their evident unfit
        ness. The difference is between tlie wear
        ers of low or high ahoss. Tho advocates
        of low shoe claim greaier freedom and
        consequently greater strength for the ank
        les in their costume. Tho believer in
        high shoes says that tbe ankle is protect
        ed from injury and helped to hear tbe
        steady strain by using the high boot.
        Most practical wheelwomen hold the
        opinion that leggings should be worn
        simply for warmth in cool weathor. As a
        rule both the high and low shoe part.es
        wear the pointed toe. The extra length
        of such a shoe is to be considered in rid
        ing, and, like any other superfluity, is
        out of place on the wheel. A shoe with a
        broad toe is much to be preferred for
        both nse and beauty in bicycling.
        A young woman while riding a bicycle
        in Paris the other day came in contact
        with the curb and was thrown to the
        ground. A paper Venetian lantern of
        the kind that is frequently used in France
        in place or the ordinary bicycle lamp set
        rire to her skirts and might have burned
        her badly had not several passers-by as
        sisted in putting out the flames before
        much damage had been done. As she re
        mounted she remarked that the accident
        would not have occurred if she had only
        worn bloomers.—New Yoilc Evening Sun.

        HE ORIGIN OF THE
        bicycle bloomer is
        not altogether lost
        in the midst of anti
        quity. It is certain
        that one day a young
        lady rider, observing,
        as many had done
        before her, that the
        ordinary skirt is ob
        'jectionable because it
        impedes the free
        movement of the
        legs and is in danger
        of being caught in the
        machineLy, hit upon the simplest and most
        obvious of devices. She reached down in
        front, caught the back edge of her skirt
        between her feet, and pulled it up between
        her knees. The result was a modest and
        practical pair of bloomers while on the
        wheel which instantly fell into the ordinary
        skirt on her descent.
        This discovery may have been made In
        Berlin, London or New York; but in all
        probability it was made in Paris.
        This improvised bloomer is still to be met
        with numerously in Paris, particularly in
        the unfashionable northern, southern and
        eastern suburbs, where holiday afternoons
        are enjoyed with more zest than prepara
        tion. The natural feminine tendency to
        worldliness, luxury and expense, however,
        has effected its substitution by regularly
        made bloomers in the more posing West
        Erid. As a matter of fact in the spring of
        Ibid bloomers have come to stay, though
        they are not called bloomers, but panta
        loons.
        Tourists who get up early enough in the
        morning to take a turn in the Bois at the
        fashionaable hour of 10 a.m. will be repaid
        by the sight of numberless young married
        ladies of the highest fashion apedaling in
        zouaves, with only old-fashioned clubmen
        to mutter at this innovation as at all other
        signs of the times. care no more for the
        park, it's disgusting. Even in the morning
        nowadays it's full of bicyclists and for
        eigners! Look at those costumes! They're
        r~o longer women!" Yet these tight or
        loose-breeched dames are of the Parisian
        -100. They wear pantaloons and ride on
        men's machines.
        Every Kind of Wheel.
        Paris is so complicated in its social or
        ders-like a universe of stars that keep
        their tracks, and yet appear to form con
        stellations-that a passing visitor may easi
        ly be deceived on the bicycle bloomer ques
        tion. The afternoon hurley-burley of the
        Bois, say, near the Avenue of the Grand
        Armee, shows every kind of co:tume, as it
        shows every kind of wheel; and it takes an
        experienced person to separate-not the
        wheat from the chaff-but the various
        grain, the wheat, the rye, the barley, the
        corn and the chaff of each from the mix
        ture. American tourist girls are often hor
        rifled at the costumes they see. They are
        more frequently moved to laughter. The
        truth is that as yet Paris has evolved no
        settled styles in bloomers. Therefore, while
        some err from daring, others err from bad
        judgment, and many more by reasons of
        economy.
        The American girls complain that the
        great majority of the Parisian bicycle
        bloomers are dowdy. It is true, and could
        hardly be otherwise. It must be remem
        bered that the middle-class Parislenne de
        pends on the ready-made gown department
        of the great shops almost as much as the
        American middle-class man depends on the
        ready-made suit industry, which so distin
        guishes our country. And, furthermore,
        the "adaptability" and "elegance" tradi
        tionally ascribed to the Parislenne has
        heretofore always had to do with very fem
        inine and frou-frou types of dress. The or
        dinary Parisienne has not yet achieved the
        real tailor-made gown; and until a recent
        date she would not have desired it. Now
        she runs to the Louvre or the Bon Marche
        for a bicycle costume--and.the whole mat
        ter being new to her, takes docilely what is
        given her.
        When the fashionable dressmakers or
        new-fangled ladies' tailors are called in the
        bloomer4. and waists are apt to be of an ex
        aggerated Scotch or English look, in whch
        all but the most up-to-date worldings of the
        400 find themselves uncomfortable. With
        this there is no mistaking English and
        American girls in the Bois today, bloomers
        or no bloomers. Perhaps it is partly be
        cause French young women are plumper
        to be polite-than our own. For example,
        with them, on the bicycle as off it, the cen
        ter of gravity yields to no dissimilation.
        One is constantly reminded of full moons
        or sofa cushions. What the dressmakers
        achiev'e in the waist they seem to lose be
        low it. The French woman being differ
        ently built from the Anglo-Saxon, both go
        ing and coming, she appears to sprawl more
        in bloomers. She looks queer enough seated
        on the machine, but once she descends ahe
        locks queerer.


        Two other factors enter into the queer
        ness of all the feminine bicycling of Paris.
        The great majority of lady riders are not
        unmarried girls of good society. These lat
        ter may attempt the wheel in the privacy
        of the country, but they do not show in any
        number in the park. In all the classes-the
        aristocracy, the bourgeoisie and the "little"
        bourgeoisie-it is the young married woman
        who pedals. This fact presents an ensem
        ble of maturity to the newly arrived Amer
        ican. Now, what would be luxurious when
        safe guarded by all the artifices of femi
        nine attire, which have stood the test of
        ages, becomes mere ostentation under the
        simplicity of the bloomer, The change for
        the great mass of French lady cyclists has
        been too great.
        Many have seen thin and tried to remedy
        it, both the lighter-minded of the "half
        world" and their more estimable sisters.
        Some-in both categories-have frankly
        taken up men's costumes, loose knicker
        bockers, and longish sack coats. Others
        wear tighlt-knegtlbreeches and fancy jerseys.
        Othersadd t'o tnis a short skirt, reaching to
        the kn s0 'with or without leggings or
        heavy ~cj~ stdekings. For these it is 'any
        thing t~gtai4ty from the organ-grinder
        monke effect "threatened by zouaves or
        bloomem~s.
        in this way t~e accomplish a great deal
        in gracefulness f outline at the expense of
        a very little modety. Speaking simply from
        the standpoint of architecture, bloomers dis
        figure lovely woman by hanging below the
        knees.
        It is almost pitiful to Lee them reveling
        in their new-fotund liberty of costume. They
        would overrun the Parisian promenade did
        not an ordinance of the prefect of police
        forbid the appearance of bicycle costume
        without a bicycle. Recently there was an
        attempt to enforce this mandate strictly,
        and it failed. The only law on which the
        prefect of pollee had to go was that for
        bidding one sex to attire itself in the garb of
        another. A test case provoked a dictum
        from a judge to the effect that bloomers or
        zonaves could not by any possibility be
        looked on as a male costume. Nowadays,
        therefore, so long as the damsels confine
        their promenades en pantalon to the festive
        quarters like Montmartre and the Latin
        Quarter, they are not iholested, being char
        itably supposed to have their wheels some
        where nearby.

        Parisiennes willingly accept what they
        know to be only doubtfully becoming! It in
        a revolution and will have far-reaching re
        sults. Indeed, many see in It the emanci
        pation of the French young girL. The pre
        tuntions upper bourgeoisie is chary of al
        lowing its daughters to ride in pubfle, but
        when the "jeune personne" takes to the
        machine at all it must be in bloomers, like
        her married siter. Apart from these, how
        ever;, a new class has been tapdby the
        machine, the lowersmiddle clswhich

        daughters; as well sons igna fathefs.
        The eheapness ot the bicycle and the
        temptations It offers4o these Parisias who
        adore the country all the more because they
        do not often see incline the learts of
        these hondst people strongly to the wheel.
        All 'the world of little employes has wel

        radicalism in the public schools is begin

        upper-middle bourgeoisie.
        If this movement pontinues, bicycle rid
        Ing may become as-respectable for young
        girls as. for their, married sisters. The
        mothers of the present day may still be very
        much of the old school-lacking its religion.
        And the daughters can scarcely be other
        wise then what they.are, trained up as they
        have teen. Still, rumors of the different
        life of English and American girls; and even
        Germarn girls, come to them, and they won
        der, with derision or regret, as may be. The
        wheel is new. It is fashionable as well as
        Popular. It may bring with it the emanci
        pation of the French young girl. And when
        it does, she will appear in bloomers.

        Mrs. Hj'ifrove Received It Last Week
        for a Bleyele Skirt.
        The palm for a rapid and skillful busi
        ness transaction must unquestionably
        be awarded to the young and pretty
        British matron, Mrs. Bygrave.
        Mrs. Bygrave landed in America on
        Friday, the last day of January, with
        a bicycle skirt of her own invention for
        sale. Within two hours of her arrival,
        while still nervous and dizzy from her
        long and earnest communion with Nep
        tune. Mrs. Bygrave had not only
        denned her new original skirt, but was
        displaying its various merits to the
        buyer of one of the largest sporting
        goods establishments in the country.
        Not satisfied wi.th the offer he made
        her, this self-confident, energetic young
        woman went forth on Saturday in
        search of greater financial inducements
        to part with her cycling skirt. The
        first establishment she visited offered
        her a royalty on all sales made. But
        Mrs. Bygrave had other ambitions and
        walked away in her patent skirt to a
        well-known firm on Twenty third street.
        The wisdom of her, course was shown
        when she promptly received an offer
        of $5,000 from the Twenty-third street
        dealers, who stipulated, of course, that
        they should receive full assurance of a
        patent from Washington. Lest there
        should be any difficulty" in regard to
        the condition of the patent, Mrs. By
        grave on Monday started for Washing
        ton, remained in the patent office two
        hours, found the coast clear for launch
        ing, as it were, the new cycling skirt,
        and returned to New York on the after
        noon train. She did not see the White
        house. That was not her business in
        Washington, she said.
        On Tuesday she visited the patent
        office in New York to make sure that
        there would be no delay in granting the
        patent, visited the firm with whom she
        was negotiating, received a check for
        $500 with a note for the additional sum
        of $4,500 so soon as the patent should be
        received, and on Wednesday morning
        sailed on the Majestic for her native
        shore, the very neat $s,ooo 'transaction
        having been accomplished in less than
        four days. _
        Her cycling skirt is the most novel
        invention in the matter of wheeling
        skirts that has yet come before the
        wheeling public. By a system of cords
        worked through openings near the
        waist line it can be made to fill three
        different varieties of long-felt wants in
        the bicycle woman.
        First of all, it is a trim, circular
        walking skirt, close fitting over the
        hips and measuring about three yards
        at the hem. To adapt this skirt to the
        "drop frame" bicycle* the middle of the
        front breadth is pulled up by means of
        a shirring string run down the front
        seam between the lining and a narrow
        casing. This string is. drawn through
        an opening at the i waist, where' it is
        fastened by means of a clasp under a
        neat pocket flap. The shirring reaches
        a short distance above the knees, leav
        ing the skirt neat and smooth fitting
        about the hips and actually forming
        two loose bags In which the knees
        work up and down without the slight
        est dragging and pulling at the waist
        line, which is the sad -and daily ex
        perience of the woman wearing the or
        dinary skirts.
        The third -possibility of the unique
        garment is developed by working the
        cords that run up the back seam and
        find an outlet under a tailor-made flap
        just over the hip. The pulling of these
        two side cords converts the skirt into
        a pair of neat and graceful bloomers
        that Will permit the fair rider, in case
        of an emergency, to mount a "diamond
        frame" bicycle with all the grace and
        agility of a masculine wheelman. By
        the use of four square leads in the hem
        of the skirt the instant the strings are
        unclasped and the rider stands erect
        the bloomers again become a walking
        skirt. There is no pulling of the gar-
        ment into shapes or adjusting of belt
        necessary. Simply press the clasps
        and the act of dismounting does the
        rest.

        Now, a true woman does not compro
        mise her modesty a whit more on the
        bicycle than she does riding on a street
        car or a buggy. All things are evil to the
        evil-minded.
        It so happens that a great many women
        use the bicycle for convenience. They
        have to go from place to place on legiti
        mate business, and it ia quite as proper
        to go on a bicycle as it is to walk. Then
        very many women ride the bicycle for
        health and others for pleasure, and if
        there be anything; immoral in it it is dis
        covered by others than those who ride
        wheels. It ia very true that some women
        bicycle riders adopt costumes that might
        be spliced out a little with the same kind
        of material, but the same is very much
        more true of some men bicyclists. The
        fact is, these are not the days of the May
        flower, but there are just as many good
        and true women now as there were in
        those days. The members of the Rescue
        League might better attend to rescuing
        their own minds from the many unfounded
        suspicions which appear to keep them in a
        etate of agitation.

        Autos have vanished and

        So this old contraption of

        this Parisian model for a

        If his wheel distracts his mind from
        the object he is trying to attain he
        gives his opponent just so much ad
        vantage which he otherwise would not
        have. So what it really amounts to
        is that the man who wishes to fight his
        duel on a bicycle must leave the man
        agement of his wheel to his feet and
        knees.
        The combatants in a mock duel of
        this nature are dressed in the ordinary
        outing costume of the cyclist. Their
        hands are clothed in gauntlets. ’ The
        stockings worn are usually faced with
        a very fine quality of chamois skins.
        The shoes are of the regulation bicycle
        fashion, with rubber soles.
        On the inner side of the trousers,
        just above the point where the leggings
        and the bottoms of the trousers meet,
        is a round piece of rubber about an
        eighth of an inch thick and seven and
        one-half inches in circumference. The
        object of this rubber is to give the
        rider a firm pressure upon the ma
        chine, just as the rubber soles of his
        shoes act as a safegmird^againgt, his
        feet slipping on the pedals.
        Each duelist wears a mask which
        has over each eye a projection of wire,
        similar in form to a small inverted
        tea cup. This gives absolute freedom
        of vision.
